# Mays Closet üõçÔ∏è
May's Closet is a buy and sell clothing retail website used to sell clothing articles I no longer wear!
<br>
## How did I make it?
* **AWS Amplify** for deployment and hosting the full-stack application
* **React**, **AWS Amplify UI**, **CSS** for the frontend
* **AWS S3 Buckets** for hosting data and storing clothing images
* **AWS AppSync** to connect with the **GraphQL API** for handling **CRUD** operations
* **AWS DynamoDB** for storing listings and clothing orders in data tables
* **AWS Lambda** for triggering functions to make payments and create clothing orders
* **Stripe** to process payments and charge the customers
* **AWS Cognito** for handling account creation for users upon checkout and setting up Admin groups for posting clothing items
